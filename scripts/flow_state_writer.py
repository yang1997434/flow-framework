"""flow_state_writer — append-only state writers for autonomous mode.

Per the v0.8 design: only the orchestrator writes canonical state. Subagents
write to their worktree journals; orchestrator merges. v0.8.0 ships writers
only — no reads from these files yet (v0.8.2 wires read paths for resume).

v0.8.1 (T4) adds `acceptance-progress.jsonl` — per-criterion lifecycle
events (`started` before invocation, `completed`/`timeout` after). Tail-read
drives in-flight resume in T9 (read path lives in flow_acceptance.py).
Concurrency model (design R3): only the orchestrator appends to canonical
jsonl; subagents never write here directly. Lock contention → audit gap →
log to stderr, proceed (mirrors v0.8.0 `append_decision` posture).

#
# Per design §8.4 (event table) + §6 R3/R4/R6/Y3/Y8/R10. Single helper
# `append_autonomy_event(task_dir, event, fields)` validates:
#   1. `event` is one of the 10 known autonomy events (fail-closed enum).
#   2. `fields` covers the per-event required-field set (fail-closed schema).
#
# Ordering note (cf. blindspot-C / D2): validation runs BEFORE any disk
# write — invalid events raise `ValueError` and never touch the journal.
# Lock contention on `decisions.jsonl` falls back to a stderr WARN (mirrors
# v0.8.0 `append_decision` posture: audit gap, not crash). Distinct from
# schema validation — a contended lock is not a schema problem and must
# not raise at the validator layer.
#
# Co-existence with v0.8.0 records (Step 6.7): the v0.8.0 `DecisionRecord`
# shape has NO `event` field; v0.8.1 autonomy events ALWAYS carry
# `event: <name>`. Readers disambiguate by presence/absence of the key —
# do NOT use `.get("event")` truthiness (the schema-parsing pitfall says
# `null` and absent must not collide).

# T5 — auto_prepare.lock state machine + 4-state crash recovery.
#
# Per design §8.1 (file path / schema / state machine), §6 R10 (boundary
# marker rationale), §6 Y8 (`auto_prepare_consumed` event proves
# consumption), §1 row 17 (`blocked_auto_prepare` status routing).
#
# Three-call surface:
#   - write_auto_prepare_lock()      — atomic write at contract-parse time,
#                                       BEFORE the `auto_engaged` event.
#   - consume_auto_prepare_lock()    — rename to `auto_prepare.consumed`
#                                       AFTER `auto_engaged` succeeds + emit
#                                       `auto_prepare_consumed` event (Y8).
#   - detect_auto_prepare_state()    — return one of 6 states for orchestrator
#                                       (T19) crash recovery routing.
#
# Atomicity choices (and why):
#   - WRITE: same `atomic_write_json()` used everywhere else in this module
#     — temp + fsync + rename within the same fs. POSIX `rename(2)` is the
#     atomic primitive; either old-or-new content is observable, never a
#     partial JSON. Rejecting re-write while a live lock is present is
#     enforced by `path.exists()` before `atomic_write_json` (the alternative,
#     `O_CREAT|O_EXCL`, would race fork-children of the same orchestrator;
#     this layer is single-writer-per-task by design — the contract).
#   - CONSUME: `os.replace(src, dst)` — POSIX-atomic rename within the same
#     dir. After the call, exactly one of `auto_prepare.lock` /
#     `auto_prepare.consumed` is observable.
#
# PID liveness: pure-Python `os.kill(pid, 0)` distinguishes
#   - `ProcessLookupError` (errno ESRCH)  → DEAD.
#   - `PermissionError`    (errno EPERM)  → ALIVE-but-not-ours (different uid).
#   - any other OSError                   → re-raise (do NOT silently treat
#                                            EINVAL/EAGAIN/etc. as "alive" or
#                                            "dead"; that would be a D2/D3
#                                            blindspot — silently swallowing
#                                            an OSError that we don't
#                                            understand).
#   The default for unknown failure is "alive" (caller will treat it as
#   `active_run` — conservative: do not mistakenly classify a live process
#   as crashed). But we re-raise unknown errno because conservative-default
#   without a record is the very D2 antipattern the pitfall doc warns about.

      † = synthetic states (not in plan's 6-state table). All three share
          `block_type=auto_prepare_interrupted` so T19 routes them
          identically; distinct state-names preserve cause/effect honesty
          per §6 contradiction-fix rule (a state name that lies about its
          cause is the kind of fallback-after-soft-degrade footgun the
          rule prohibits).

    Detection-order rationale (D1 / blindspot-C):
      1. Read lock-presence + engaged-presence FIRST (cheap, no parse).
         Engaged-scan can raise `JournalCorruptError` if decisions.jsonl
         has a malformed line — caught and routed to
         `interrupted_journal_corrupt` (codex T5 R1 [P2] fix; silent-skip
         was a D2 fallback bypass — a truncated `auto_engaged` line could
         be the only proof of engagement).
      2. If both present → orphan (lock that should have been consumed
         when engaged was emitted; we report this for cleanup, not for
         classification).
      3. Only when lock-present-and-not-engaged do we parse lock JSON +
         consult contract hash → host → pid liveness. The contract-hash
         check is a `==` compare, NOT `.get(...) or ""` — see schema-parsing-
         get-vs-in pitfall: an explicitly-null `contract_hash` in the
         on-disk lock indicates a malformed lock and MUST NOT silently
         match an arbitrary current hash.
      4. Contract-mismatch is checked BEFORE host/pid because it's the
         most decisive signal: if the contract changed, the recovery
         decision is `block` regardless of host/pid.
      5. Host-mismatch is checked BEFORE pid because cross-host PID
         collision (codex T5 R1 [P2]): lock written on machine A copied/
         synced to B. On B, `_is_pid_alive(lock_pid)` would treat any
         locally-live PID as "the original orchestrator" — coincidence.
         Without the host check, recovery classifies as `active_run`
         forever and never proceeds.
