# Changelog

## v0.8.1 — 2026-05-07

**Autonomy enabled.** The execution refusal in v0.8.0 is replaced with a
hardened 8-gate safety stack:

- **Contract schema**: 6 new fields (`max_codex_rounds_per_task`,
  `notification.throttle_min`, `notification.tier2_enabled`,
  `idempotent_cmd_allowlist`, `post_merge_regression_optional`,
  criterion-level `idempotent` / `timeout_sec` / `post_merge_skip`).
  Schema version stays at `1` (additive); v0.8.0 readers ignore new
  fields with warning.
- **8-gate runner**: baseline / subagent / manifest verify / codex
  review / acceptance criteria / regression smoke / local merge /
  post-merge verify (in ephemeral verification worktree).
- **Atomic merge**: 9-step transactional sequence with explicit gap-
  by-gap crash recovery.
- **Notification**: 3-tier with throttle + Tier 2 disable + OSC 9
  auto-detect + archive on resume.
- **Crash recovery**: 5-state classifier (pre-lock / lock+dead-pid /
  auto_engaged / mid-merge / verification-orphan).
- **Staleness**: 5 explicit triggers (base branch / lockfile / prd
  mtime / dep version / baseline fail) wired into `flow doctor`.
- **Nested-autonomy**: `FLOW_AUTONOMY_PARENT_PID` env-var mechanical
  guard at orchestrator entry.

**Validation**: full suite 798 cases passing (717 smoke + 81 unit);
`flow doctor` clean; `flow_selftest.py` ALL CHECKS PASSED; 3 contract
fixtures (`docs/fixtures/v081-{minimal,typical,advanced}.json`)
validate; v0.8.0 forward-compat smoke green.

**Deferred to v0.8.2**: AFK detector loop (T17), budget runtime
enforcement (T18), Phase 2 retry loop, staleness checks inside the
dispatch loop, Tier 3 notification command execution. All four parse
forward-compat in v0.8.1 contracts so migration is monotonic.

No backward-incompatible changes. v0.6/0.7 plans without contracts
continue to run interactively.

## v0.8.0 — 2026-05-06

### Major: Autonomous mode foundation (execution gated to v0.8.1)

The `contract.json` schema lands. Tasks can now declare autonomy scope,
budget, irreversible actions, acceptance criteria, and stop-condition
decision tables. Dry-run orchestrator builds per-task file ownership
manifests and previews what v0.8.1 *would* execute.

**New CLI:**
- `flow contract --init <slug>` — generate template
- `flow contract --validate <slug>` — schema + integrity check
- `flow orchestrator --dry-run <slug>` — print plan + manifests
- `flow orchestrator --auto-execute <slug>` — refused with explanatory error

**New schema:**
- `.flow/tasks/<slug>/contract.json` (versioned: `contract_schema_version: 1`)
- `progress.md` frontmatter pointer: `contract_path`, `contract_schema_version`,
  `autonomy_mode`, `last_checkpoint`
- State writers (no reads yet): `decisions.jsonl`, `review-issues.jsonl`,
  `checkpoints/<ts>.md`, `blocked.md`

**New capabilities:**
- `autonomy_orchestrator` (placeholder; activated in v0.8.1)
- `acceptance_verify` (placeholder; activated in v0.8.1)

**`flow doctor` extension:** contract.json existence + schema-version check
for every task whose `progress.md` declares `autonomy_mode`.

### Backwards compatibility

Pure additive. Missing contract → interactive (v0.7 behavior unchanged).
Forward-compat: unknown contract fields accepted with warning.

### Migration

See `docs/v0.8-migration.md`.

## v0.7.1 — 2026-05-05

### Fixed

- **`flow waves` + `flow_wave_runner` user-data path resolution**
  (`scripts/flow_wave_planner.py`, `scripts/flow_wave_runner.py`):
  six callsites resolved against the framework `REPO_ROOT`
  (= `Path(__file__).parent.parent`, i.e. flow-framework's own checkout)
  instead of the user's project:
  - `_progress_md_for_slug()` and `_cache_path_for_slug()` (planner)
  - the two `_get_base_commit()` calls in `cli_cache_check` / `cli_write_cache` (planner)
  - the `--repo` default in `cli_diff_names` (runner) — per-task git-diff verifier
  - the waiver log path in `cli_waive` (runner) — `wave-decisions.log` writer

  Symptoms: `flow waves --preview <slug>` invoked from any project other than
  flow-framework itself failed with `ERROR: progress.md not found for <slug>`;
  `cli_write_cache` and `cli_waive` would write artifacts under the framework
  directory rather than the project's `.flow/tasks/<slug>/`; `cli_diff_names`
  would diff the framework's git history when `--repo` was omitted.

  Fix: introduce `_project_root()` in `flow_wave_planner.py` that walks
  `Path.cwd()` up looking for a `.flow/` directory (mirrors
  `common.paths.get_project_root()` behavior), then route the six user-data
  path/git lookups through it. `flow_wave_runner.py` imports the helper from
  the planner module to stay DRY. SHARED_ARTIFACTS and `sys.path` setup
  continue to use framework `REPO_ROOT` (correctly — they refer to
  framework-shipped assets).

### Tests

- New `TestProjectRoot` in `tests/smoke/test_wave_planner.py`: 5 cases
  covering project-dir cwd, nested-subdir cwd, fallback when no `.flow`
  ancestor exists (skipped automatically if the OS tempdir itself sits under
  a `.flow` chain), and explicit assertions that progress.md / cache paths
  do **not** leak into the framework directory. Uses `addCleanup` to
  restore cwd and `shutil.rmtree` the tmpdir.
- New `TestWaveRunnerCLIPathResolution` in
  `tests/smoke/test_wave_runner_helpers.py`: 2 cases covering the two
  runner CLI fixes — `cli_diff_names` defaults to project root when
  `--repo` is omitted (drives a real throwaway git repo), and `cli_waive`
  writes its log under the project (not the framework).
- Suite total grows 18 → 23 (planner) and 6 → 8 (runner); full smoke
  247 → 249 passing; `flow_selftest.py` PASSED.

### Migration

Pure bugfix — no schema, capability, or CLI surface changes. Re-run
`flow install render-prompts` is **not** required (no rendered prompts
touched). After upgrading, `flow waves --preview <slug>` works from any
project containing a `.flow/` directory.

## v0.7.0 — 2026-05-05

### Major: Dependency-aware parallel subagent dispatch

Phase 2 now supports `wave-dispatch` mode: implementer subagents that touch disjoint files run in parallel within a "wave"; cross-wave runs sequential. Conservative defaults (cap=3, mechanical disjointness primary, LLM concept-veto, post-hoc git-diff verification, shared-artifact denylist).

**New skills**:
- `flow:flow-wave-planner` — decompose plan into waves, cache reproducibly
- `flow:flow-wave-runner` — paired implementer/spec-reviewer dispatch + sequential merge + code-quality reviewer

**New capabilities**: `wave_planning`, `wave_dispatch`.

**New CLI**:
- `flow waves --preview <slug>` / `--show <slug>` / `--invalidate <slug>` — wave decomposition inspection
- `flow doctor` — extended with writes hygiene, broad-glob, SHARED_ARTIFACTS overlap, stale cache
- `flow doctor --suggest-writes <slug>` — advisory `writes:` suggestions for legacy plans

**Plan schema**: optional `### Tasks` YAML block in progress.md with per-task `writes:` glob (and `reads:` hint). Plans without `### Tasks` block fall back to all-serial (zero regression).

**Capability fallback**: missing `wave_planning` or `wave_dispatch` → automatic fallback to existing v0.6 dispatch path (zero regression for users without v0.7).

### Backwards compatibility

- All v0.6.x plans run unchanged
- Capability registry baseline preserved (no removals)
- No behavior changes for existing flow doctor / flow task / flow promote subcommands

### Spec

Full design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-05-v0.7-parallel-dispatch-design.md` (3 rounds of codex consult absorbed: round-1 architecture, round-2 bug fixes including LLM-veto-only / per-task pre-post diff / SHARED_ARTIFACTS glob-overlap / failed_blocking-non-waivable, round-3 verification fixes including per-task pre-post sha verifier and contiguous-prefix planner).

### Out of scope (deferred to v0.8+)

- Cross-phase parallel
- Subagent-to-subagent direct communication within a wave
- Auto-learning from historical plan executions

## v0.6.1 (2026-05-05)

Patch addressing the two Minor follow-ups from v0.6.0 final code review
(closes #9, #10). Both were "documentation / observability gaps that
don't break anything but defer surprise to runtime." Folded into a single
patch since they're small and complementary.

### Fixed

- **#9 — `safety_guardrails` cross-phase discoverability**: each phase
  SKILL.md (`flow-phase{1,2,3,4}-*/SKILL.md`) now begins with a one-line
  blockquote referencing `{{capability:safety_guardrails}}` and pointing
  to the orchestrator's `§Cross-cutting capabilities` section. Previously
  the safety reminder was only in `flow-orchestrator/SKILL.md`, which is
  not loaded once a phase skill takes over. Now the reminder is in active
  context regardless of which phase Claude is executing. Per-phase
  destructive-op examples tailored to that phase's typical operations
  (Phase 2: `git reset --hard` / migrations / `kubectl delete`; Phase 3:
  `git branch -D` / force-push / `git clean -fd`; etc).

- **#10 — capability `requires_cli` is now consumed by `flow doctor`**:
  new `check_capability_clis()` walks the registry and warns if any
  capability's declared `requires_cli` dependency is missing. Mixed-
  semantics aware: `requires_cli` may name either a PATH binary
  (e.g. `codex`) OR a Claude skill bundle under `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`
  (e.g. `gstack`). New helper `_is_dependency_available()` checks both
  locations. Pre-existing in v0.5: `cross_model_*` capabilities had
  `requires_cli` set but nothing consumed it; v0.6.0 added 11 more
  entries with the same pattern. v0.6.1 closes the loop — `flow doctor`
  now warns "gstack not available — affects 11 capability/ies: …" if the
  user hasn't installed gstack, surfacing what would silently no-op.

### Added — tests

- `tests/smoke/test_doctor_capability_clis.py` — 4 tests covering
  `_is_dependency_available()` (skill bundle / PATH binary / missing) and
  `check_capability_clis()` (no-crash + warning emission when missing).
  Suite total grows 15 → 19.

### Migration

Pure additive — no schema changes, no removed capabilities. Re-run
`flow install render-prompts` after upgrade to refresh phase SKILL.md
files with the new safety blockquote.

## v0.6.0 (2026-05-05)

Capability registry expansion — wires 19 new capabilities from gstack /
superpowers / pr-review-toolkit / planning-with-files / code-review into
Flow's per-phase orchestration. Capability count grows 14 → 33. Phase 1
gains hat-shifted brainstorming (Engineer / DX / Security perspectives)
that replaces gstack:plan-*-review's batched output with one-question-
at-a-time UX consistent with `superpowers:brainstorming`.

### Added — Phase 1 (2 capabilities + hat-shift)

- `multi_step_plan` → `planning-with-files:plan` (B/C-size tasks)
- `dev_setup` → `gstack:setup-deploy` (deploy task initialization)
- Phase 1 SKILL.md hat-shifted brainstorming continuation
  (Engineer / DX / Security hats; user picks 0-N; same one-question-
  at-a-time rhythm as base brainstorm)

### Added — Phase 2 (5 capabilities)

- `subagent_discipline` → `superpowers:subagent-driven-development`
  (pairs with parallel_dispatch — discipline + orchestration)
- `execute_plan_discipline` → `superpowers:executing-plans`
  (closes loop with multi_step_plan)
- `systematic_debug` → `superpowers:systematic-debugging`
  (4-phase root-cause discipline; first-line debug)
- `deep_investigate` → `gstack:investigate`
  (escalation when systematic_debug insufficient)
- `land_and_deploy` → `gstack:land-and-deploy`
  (alt to deploy_chain; one-shot for small confident changes)

### Added — Phase 3 (8 capabilities)

- **`verify_completion`** → `superpowers:verification-before-completion`
  **MANDATORY at Phase 3 entry — closes a security-class gap where
  Flow previously allowed self-reported success without actual
  verification. Non-skippable.**
- `code_review_small` → `code-review:code-review`
  (5 Sonnet parallel + Haiku confidence; diff < 200 lines)
- `code_review_large` → `pr-review-toolkit:review-pr`
  (6-specialist agent panel; diff ≥ 200 lines)
- `review_request_etiquette` →
  `superpowers:requesting-code-review,superpowers:receiving-code-review`
  (request scope discipline + verify-before-agreeing chain)
- `pre_land_review` → `gstack:review`
  (SQL safety / LLM trust / conditional side effects)
- `quality_health` → `gstack:health`
  (composite 0-10 quality score; Phase 3 entry gate)
- `perf_baseline` → `gstack:benchmark`
  (Web Vitals + resource size regression; perf-sensitive tasks)
- `post_deploy_qa` → `gstack:qa`
  (active deployed-site QA; complements canary's passive monitoring)

### Added — Phase 4 (2 capabilities)

- `branch_finish` → `superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch`
  (structured merge / PR / cleanup decision)
- `changelog_gen` → `gstack:changelog-generator`
  (auto-generate user-facing changelog from commit history)

### Added — Cross-cutting (2 capabilities)

- `safety_guardrails` → `gstack:careful`
  (destructive command warnings — orchestrator invokes before
  rm -rf / DROP TABLE / force-push / kubectl delete / migrations.
  Hook-based auto-fire deferred to v0.7)
- `weekly_retro` → `gstack:retro`
  (cross-task weekly review; user-triggered or `/loop weekly`)

### Added — defensive infrastructure

- `scripts/flow_capability.py`: `load_registry()` strips `_`-prefixed
  keys from capabilities and model_roles dicts (defends against marker-key
  AttributeError in `flow_skill_diff.analyze_plugin` and noise pollution
  in `cmd_list` output).
- `tests/smoke/test_capability.py`: new `test_v06_additions_are_well_formed`
  asserts each v0.6.0 capability has dict shape + `default` (str) +
  `description` fields.

### Out of scope (rejected during design)

- `plan_ceo_critique` (gstack:plan-ceo-review) — user opted out
- `autoplan` (gstack:autoplan) — bundles all 4 plan-*-review
- `plan_eng_critique` / `plan_devex_critique` — replaced by hat-shift
- `release_docs` / `project_learnings` / `security_audit` /
  `silent-failure-hunter` — deferred to v0.7

### Migration

Pure additive — no existing capability removed or renamed. Project-level
overrides in `.flow/config.local.yaml` continue to work. Re-run
`flow install render-prompts` after upgrade to substitute new
`{{capability:X}}` placeholders into `~/.claude/{commands,skills}/flow/`.

### Tests

`tests/smoke/test_capability.py` REQUIRED_CAPS extended 13 → 33 entries.
Suite total grows 14 → 15 tests (new: `test_v06_additions_are_well_formed`).
All pass + flow_selftest.py PASSED.

## v0.5.9 (2026-05-05)

Cosmetic / UX cleanup. Fresh `flow init` no longer leaves the project in a
state where `git status` perpetually flags `?? .flow/workspace/` and
`?? .flow/config.yaml` as untracked. The `.gitignore` rules were already
correct (`.flow/workspace/*` + `!.flow/workspace/.gitkeep`), but `flow init`
never told the user to stage the un-ignored placeholder + project config —
so every adopter saw the same noisy untracked entries forever.

### Fixed

- **`.gitignore` duplicates** (this repo): removed the orphan "defensive"
  block (`.flow/.runtime/` + `.flow/config.local.yaml`) that duplicated
  the canonical "Flow Framework" block lower down.
- **Self-bootstrapping noise** (this repo): `.flow/workspace/.gitkeep`
  and `.flow/config.yaml` are now committed, so the workspace dir
  materializes after clone and project-level config is reproducible.

### Added

- **`flow init` next-step hint** (`scripts/flow_init.py`): on completion,
  print the exact `git add` command for the un-ignored placeholders that
  `flow init` just created. No auto-staging — the user is in control.

## v0.5.8 (2026-05-05)

Phase determination now respects user's authoritative `phase:` declaration in
progress.md frontmatter as an upper bound on section-based advancement. Fixes
the brainstorm-stuck-at-phase3 bug where logging brainstorm milestones
(sub-agent dispatches, decision lock entries) into `## Execute Log` during
phase 1 caused `<flow-state>` to mis-report the task as `phase3-finish` even
though the user was still iterating on prd.md and the architecture wasn't
locked.

### Fixed

- **Phase-state spurious advancement** (`claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py`):
  `determine_phase` now combines section-based heuristic with the frontmatter
  `phase:` field as an upper-bound cap. If the user explicitly sets
  `phase: triage` or `phase: research`, the hook returns `phase1-plan`
  regardless of how much content lives in `## Execute Log`. The frontmatter
  value is the authoritative declaration of "where I am"; `/flow:continue` is
  responsible for advancing it. Section heuristic still wins in the inverse
  direction (stale frontmatter `implement` with empty Plan → phase1-plan from
  sections), so a forgotten frontmatter advance can't promote past actual
  artifact reality.

### Added

- New helpers in `claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py`: `parse_frontmatter_phase`
  (extracts and maps the YAML `phase:` field; defensive against malformed YAML),
  `min_phase` (returns the earlier of two canonical phases per `PHASE_ORDER`).
  Constants: `PHASE_ORDER`, `PHASE_FRONTMATTER_MAP`.
- Test coverage in `tests/smoke/test_phase_determination.py`: 21 new tests
  across `FrontmatterPhaseParse`, `MinPhase`, `FrontmatterPhaseCap` classes —
  including the actual user-reported regression case (frontmatter triage +
  Plan/Execute filled with brainstorm artifacts → must return phase1-plan)
  and the cross-model codex review finding (sections-all-filled → must reach
  done even when frontmatter caps at `sediment`).

### Cross-model review notes

Per cross-model codex review on this fix, the section heuristic is now allowed
to short-circuit the frontmatter cap when `section_phase == "done"`. Why:
`PHASE_FRONTMATTER_MAP` has no key for `done` (the frontmatter enum tops out at
`sediment`), so without this short-circuit, a fully-completed task with
`phase: sediment` and all sections filled would forever report `phase4-sediment`
instead of `done`. Two regression tests added.

## v0.5.7 (2026-05-05)

Stabilization release. Fixes the Sonnet alias env-var routing that was
silently downgrading sub-agent dispatch (or forcing operators to fall
back to haiku — research-depth-inadequate), and the phase-state
"false-done" bug where automated autosave breadcrumbs in
`progress.md ## Sediment Notes` made `<flow-state>` mis-report any task
as `done` from Phase 1 onward. Adds an explicit Sonnet → Opus fallback
chain to the sub-agent dispatch protocol so operators don't silently
downgrade. Wires the new `external_skills` dependency section into
`flow install` + `flow doctor` (gstack is now properly diagnosed and
installable). Per cross-model codex review, the breadcrumb-filtering
regex now consumes the full line so migrated tasks with old breadcrumbs
in Sediment Notes don't falsely advance past Phase 4.

### Fixed

- **Agent tool model dispatch**: `defaults.json` `model_roles.*.default`
  now ships **aliases** (`sonnet`/`opus`/`haiku`), not full model IDs.
  The Agent tool's `model` parameter is enum-restricted to those three
  aliases — full IDs were rejected with `InputValidationError`. Added
  per-role `fallback` field documenting the retry alias on dispatch
  failure.
- **Phase-state false `done`** (`claude/hooks/user-prompt-submit.py`):
  `is_section_filled` now filters the autosave breadcrumb pattern
  (defense-in-depth); `determine_phase` now requires **sequential**
  filling (Plan → Execute → Verify → Sediment), so a stray write to a
  later section can't skip earlier empty sections.
- **Sediment Notes pollution source** (`scripts/flow_autosave.py`):
  the `distill queued` breadcrumb is re-routed from
  `progress.md ## Sediment Notes` to
  `~/.flow/.runtime/autosave-log-<cwd>.md` (out-of-band of any
  phase-determining file).
- **Breadcrumb regex consumes full line** (codex review P1): old regex
  anchored on the prefix only, leaving residual ` (trigger=...) — note`
  text that still counted as section content. Now matches up to the
  newline so migrated old progress.md files don't falsely advance phase.

### Added

- `external_skills` section in `dependencies.json` for loose-skill
  bundles distributed outside the marketplace+plugin system. First
  entry: **gstack** (`~/.claude/skills/gstack/`) with `requires_cli`,
  `capabilities`, and a documented `install` command.
- `flow install install-external-skills` — new subcommand that clones
  + builds bundles declared under `external_skills`, idempotent on
  existing installs, fails-closed on missing required CLIs.
- `flow doctor` — new section reporting external skills presence +
  missing CLIs; entries count toward total-missing for exit code.
- `claude/commands/flow/start.md` + `claude/skills/flow/flow-phase1-plan/SKILL.md`:
  explicit **Sub-agent dispatch protocol** — primary `sonnet` alias,
  fallback `opus`, never haiku for research depth.
- `tests/smoke/test_phase_determination.py` — 17 unit tests covering
  `is_section_filled` across all observed breadcrumb variants,
  `determine_phase` sequential AND-chain, and three regression tests
  for the false-`done` scenarios.
- `.flow/pitfalls/{agent-sonnet-alias-stale, phase-state-triple-bug,
  context-mode-mcp-flake, flow-protocol-needs-fallback-chain}.md` — 4
  pitfall captures so future tasks reference these failure modes.

### Changed

- `claude/hooks/stop.py` docstring updated to reflect breadcrumb
  destination change (was: progress.md Sediment Notes; now: runtime log).
- `claude/capabilities/defaults.json` `_comment` updated to reflect
  alias-based dispatch and the role of `ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL`
  env vars in concrete-id resolution (1M-context variants
  recommended).

### Tests

- Suite: 80 → 97 (+17 in `test_phase_determination.py`).

## v0.5.6 (2026-05-04)

Two new CLI surfaces resolving GitHub issues #4 and #5. Both were
deferred from v0.5.3 as feature additions.

### Added

- **`flow task phase <name>`** (#4) — advance the current task's phase
  field via CLI instead of hand-editing frontmatter. Validates against
  the enum (triage|research|implement|check|verify|sediment), atomic-writes
  via `safe_io.locked_text_rmw`, appends an Execute Log entry, and
  records a `phase_transition` event in `history.jsonl` when
  `.checkpoint/` exists. Accepts `--slug` for non-active tasks.
- **`flow sediment <type> <slug>`** (#5) — render a pitfall/pattern/ADR
  from `templates/`, write to `.flow/{pitfalls,patterns,ADRs}/`, and
  link from the active task's progress.md `## Sediment Notes`. ADRs
  auto-number (`0001-`, `0002-`, ...) by scanning existing files;
  explicit `0042-` prefix in slug is respected. Per-type flags:
  `--severity` (pitfall), `--tier` (pattern). Eliminates Phase 4's
  manual boilerplate (template select → substitute → write → link).

### Tests

- Suite: 143 → 155 (+12 across `test_flow_task_cli.py` extension and
  new `test_flow_sediment.py`).

## v0.5.5 (2026-05-04)

Patch release — fix #7: `dependencies.json` referenced a nonexistent
`andrejkarpathy/karpathy-skills` GitHub repo. Discovered by v0.5.4's
cleaner SSH→HTTPS error path, which removed the SSH failure that had
been masking the underlying 404.

### Fixed

- **#7 nonexistent karpathy-skills repo** — changed marketplace source
  from `andrejkarpathy/karpathy-skills` (404) to `forrestchang/andrej-karpathy-skills`
  (the actual fork). Local marketplace identifier `karpathy-skills` is
  unchanged so existing installs aren't disturbed.

## v0.5.4 (2026-05-04)

Patch release — single-fix for the SSH-only marketplace clone failure
flagged in PR #1's "Notes for reviewer" and reproduced on this machine
during v0.5.3 selftest.

### Fixed

- **`flow install` SSH→HTTPS fallback** — `cmd_register_marketplaces` and
  `cmd_install_plugins` now inject `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT/KEY/VALUE` env vars
  into their `claude plugin` subprocess calls, telling git (2.31+) to
  rewrite `git@github.com:` to `https://github.com/` for the duration
  of that subprocess only. Eliminates the "SSH host key not in
  known_hosts" failure path on machines without SSH keys configured.
  Zero impact on installs that already worked (the rewrite is a no-op
  when the URL is already HTTPS).

## v0.5.3 (2026-05-04)

Patch release with 6 fixes — 2 local L3-dogfood findings + PR #1 (path
placeholder fix from yang1997434) + 3 GitHub issues from other-machine
smoke testing.

### Fixed

- **PR #1** (path placeholders) — replaced 11 hardcoded `~/projects/flow-framework/`
  occurrences across 5 source files with `{{REPO_ROOT}}/` so the renderer
  in `flow_install.py` substitutes the real install path on every machine.
  Plus 2 regression checks in `flow_selftest.py`.
- **L-1 progress.md write race** — `post-tool-bash.append_commit_to_progress`
  and `post-tool-edit.upsert_files_section` both did unsync'd RMW on
  `progress.md`; concurrent fires could lose one section's update. Fix:
  added `safe_io.locked_text_rmw()` helper using fcntl.LOCK_EX; both
  hooks routed through it. New unit test verifies 8 threads × 25
  appends produce 200 distinct entries with no loss.
- **L-2 `/flow:pause` Step 6 task_path bug** — prompt did
  `Path(".flow/tasks") / Path(.current-task content)` but `.current-task`
  already contains the full relative path. Fixed to read directly.
- **Issue #6 `flow doctor` context-mode false-negative** — added a third
  positive signal: read `~/.claude/settings.json` `enabledPlugins` and
  match `context-mode@context-mode`. Doctor no longer warns on green
  installs.
- **Issue #3 `flow task archive` slug + finish ordering** — `archive`
  now strips `^\d{2}-\d{2}-` prefix so both dated and bare-slug forms
  work. `finish` no longer clears `.current-task` (leaves it for
  `archive`). The natural copy-paste from `flow task list` now works.
- **Issue #2 `/flow:codex-review` non-git fallback** — detects whether
  cwd is a git repo and falls back to `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check -`
  with a content-built prompt when not. Restores the "any project" promise.

### Tests

- Suite: 135 → 143 (+4 from `LockedTextRmw` test class, +4 from new
  `test_flow_task_cli.py` covering Issue #3 archive slug + finish
  ordering).
- Selftest now rejects rendered files containing `{{REPO_ROOT}}` or
  `projects/flow-framework` — regression guard from PR #1.

## v0.5.2 (2026-05-04)

Patch release fixing a test-isolation bug.

### Fixed

- **Hook integration tests leaked state into real `~/.flow/.runtime/`** — 3 of
  the 4 v0.5 tests (`test_v05_precompact_hook.py`, `test_v05_e2e.py`,
  `test_v05_sessionstart_compact.py`) invoked hook scripts via
  `subprocess.run` without an `env=` override, so the hook scripts read
  `FLOW_HOME` from the parent process and wrote test-task nudge-state
  files (`nudge-state-01-01-demo.json`, `nudge-state-01-01-e2e.json`) into
  the user's actual runtime dir. Discovered during v0.5.1 framework
  validation. Fix: pin `FLOW_HOME` to a per-test tempdir in each
  `subprocess.run` `env=` arg, mirroring `test_v05_postool_integration.py`'s
  `_isolated_runtime_env` pattern.

### Tests

- All 3 fixed tests now create a `runtime` tempdir in setUp and pass it via
  `env=` to subprocess hook invocations. tearDown cleans up.
- Suite total still 135 (no test added; isolation is internal).

## v0.5.1 (2026-05-04)

Patch release covering two bugs found during v0.5.0 final validation
that were deferred to a follow-up.

### Fixed

- **`credential_grep` `(?i)` regex prefix** — GNU `grep -E` treats `(?i)` as
  a literal optional group, breaking the intended case-insensitive scan.
  The `-i` flag (already passed) provides case-insensitivity correctly.
  Local dev environments with `ugrep` aliased as `grep` masked the bug.
- **Selftest dry-fire fixtures** for `pre-compact.py` and `post-tool-edit.py`
  — these v0.5 hooks were validated by `flow doctor` isolation check +
  live invocation, but absent from `flow_selftest.py::HOOK_FIXTURES`.

### Tests

- Restored the credential-leak integration test case in
  `test_v05_postool_integration.py` that v0.5.0's polish work had to
  substitute due to the credential_grep regex bug.
- Smoke suite total: 134 → 135.
- Selftest hook dry-fire count: 5 → 7.

## v0.5.0 (2026-05-04)

Foundation for **auto-resume on context pressure**. Manual flow hardening
+ infra for v0.6.0 autopilot. Spec at `docs/specs/2026-05-04-auto-resume-design.md`.

### Highlights

- **PreCompact hook** — writes mechanical snapshot before Claude Code auto-compacts.
- **Per-task `.checkpoint/`** — `intent.md` + `mechanical.json` + `history.jsonl`
  capture in-flight state. `.gitignored` by default.
- **Atomic writes + fcntl.flock** — all v0.5+ state files go through `safe_io.py`.
  Concurrent appends to `history.jsonl` proven race-free under 8 threads.
- **Append-only hint outbox** — replaces single-file cascade hint that codex
  pre-merge review flagged as lossy.
- **Context-pressure nudge** — PostToolUse hook estimates context % from
  `transcript_path`, suggests `/flow:pause` once per compact cycle when ≥50%.
  Best-effort: model relays text, user sees in conversation.
- **Enhanced `/flow:pause`** — writes intent.md snapshot + cascade hint.
- **Enhanced `/flow:resume`** — reads checkpoint, surfaces Next Action,
  warns on staleness.
- **SessionStart on `compact`** — restores intent + mechanical context after
  auto-compact, model awaits user signal (no auto-execute).

### Added

- `scripts/common/safe_io.py` — atomic_write_text / atomic_write_json /
  append_jsonl_locked
- `scripts/common/hint_outbox.py` — write_hint / list_pending / mark_processed
- `scripts/common/context_estimator.py` — estimate_context_pct
- `scripts/common/checkpoint_paths.py` — per-task path helpers
- `scripts/common/mechanical.py` — build_payload (mechanical.json schema)
- `scripts/common/nudge.py` — maybe_nudge_text / acknowledge / rotate_window
- `claude/hooks/pre-compact.py` — PreCompact hook
- `tests/smoke/test_v05_*.py` — 8 new test modules including
  `test_v05_postool_integration.py` (subprocess-driven hook integration).
  Suite total: 73 → 133 cases.

### Changed

- `claude/hooks/post-tool-bash.py` — adds nudge + throttled mechanical update
- `claude/hooks/post-tool-edit.py` — adds nudge + throttled mechanical update
- `claude/hooks/session-start.py` — compact-matcher branch reads checkpoint
- `claude/commands/flow/pause.md` — Steps 6-8 (intent.md + hint + ack)
- `claude/commands/flow/resume.md` — Step 0 (personal /resume hint) + 1.5
- `scripts/flow_install.py` — `pre-compact.py` added to FLOW_OWNED_MARKERS
- `scripts/flow_init.py` — propagates `.checkpoint/` to project `.gitignore`
- `claude/hooks/settings.template.json` — PreCompact entry

### Not yet shipped (deferred to v0.6.0)

- `/flow:start --autopilot` and autopilot state machine
- R5 sanity check via external evidence (downgrade-only)
- Hard budgets (tool calls / files / time)
- Destructive-command denylist
- Explicit `done_when` checklist replacing completion-promise

These are designed in the spec but require dogfooding v0.5.0 first.

## v0.4.0 (2026-05-04)

Major v0.4 release. Addresses 9 sub-projects identified in the v0.3.1 audit
(`05-04-audit-flow-issues`). Production goal: **断点能记 / 长期记忆能沉淀 / 踩坑能沉淀**.

### Highlights

- **Capability registry** — prompt files no longer hard-code skill names. 13 capabilities
  + 5 model roles, all overridable via `flow.config.local.yaml`. Skill churn → 1 yaml line.
- **Real-automation install** — `install.sh` declarative (`dependencies.json`-driven):
  registers marketplaces, installs plugins via `claude plugin install`, merges hooks into
  `~/.claude/settings.json` with isolated matcher entries (Issue #415 mitigation), runs
  `flow selftest` to prove it actually works.
- **Worktree-per-task (default `shared`, opt-in `worktree`)** — task isolation that doesn't
  poison the shared tree on cross-task switches. `flow status` / `flow switch` UX added.
- **Three-tier autosave** — Lv1 trickle (git commit / file touch append) / Lv2 phase-boundary
  / Lv3 distill-on-pause-or-stop with cooldown + heartbeat. Layer-1 raw persistence delegated
  to context-mode plugin (hard dep).
- **Ralph bash-loop** — Phase 2 alt mode for autonomous PRD-checklist runs. `scripts/flow_ralph.sh`
  reimplements the Anthropic ralph-wiggum pattern in bash to avoid Stop-hook collisions.
- **Skill diff hook** — SessionStart compares installed plugins to last snapshot, scores
  capability overlap (Szymkiewicz–Simpson), surfaces "consider replacing X with Y" suggestions.
- **Rule integration** — flow phases explicitly reference `~/.claude/rules/code-delivery.md`,
  `code-review.md`, `knowledge-base.md`; new `behavioral_guidelines` capability invokes
  Karpathy's guidelines at the implement boundary.

### Added

- `dependencies.json` — declarative manifest (system commands / marketplaces / plugins)
- `claude/capabilities/defaults.json` — built-in capability + model_role mapping
- `scripts/flow_capability.py` — resolver + template renderer (dotted access supported)
- `scripts/flow_install.py` — install orchestrator (5 subcommands + dry-run)
- `scripts/flow_doctor.py` — environment diagnostic incl. hook-isolation + context-mode check
- `scripts/flow_selftest.py` — functional verification (hooks dry-fire / init / task-roundtrip /
  plugins / rendered prompts / doctor recap)
- `scripts/flow_skill_diff.py` — capability overlap analysis with per-(spec, version) cache
- `scripts/flow_autosave.py` — Lv1/Lv2/Lv3 orchestrator (queue-based; LLM distill deferred to
  next interactive session, never invoked from hook context)
- `scripts/flow_ralph.sh` — Phase 2 ralph-loop wrapper (375 LOC, dry-run + fake-mode for tests)
- `claude/hooks/post-tool-edit.py` — Lv1 file-touch tracking with debounce
- `claude/hooks/settings.template.json` — replaces old `.snippet`; templated `{{REPO_ROOT}}`
- `tests/smoke/` — 73 unittest cases + 12 ralph bash-test cases (was: empty in v0.3.1)

### Changed

- `claude/skills/flow/*/SKILL.md` and `claude/commands/flow/*.md` — every concrete skill name /
  model name replaced with `{{capability:X}}` / `{{model:Y}}` placeholder; rendered at install
- `install.sh` — slim orchestrator over `flow_install.py`; auto-removes legacy symlinks before
  rendering; runs selftest at end and fails install if non-functional
- `claude/hooks/stop.py` — removed raw save (delegated to context-mode); now triggers Lv3 distill
  with 5-min cooldown
- `claude/hooks/post-tool-bash.py` — added Lv1 git-commit append (hash-uniqueness debounce);
  preserved credential grep
- `claude/hooks/session-start.py` — runs `flow_skill_diff.py diff --quiet` (best-effort, 8s
  timeout) and surfaces pending suggestions in injected context
- `scripts/flow_task.py` — worktree creation + `.location` file + `cmd_status` (tree view) +
  `cmd_switch` (eval-friendly cd output) + worktree cleanup on archive
- `templates/flow.config.yaml.template` — new fields: `task_isolation`, `phase2_mode`, `autosave`
- `templates/progress.md.template` — added YAML frontmatter (`slug` / `status` / `phase` /
  `blocked_by`) for `cmd_status` to read

### Fixed (P0 from audit)

- `claude/hooks/pre-tool-task.py:62` — removed `or True` debug leftover
- `scripts/flow_task.py:cmd_archive` — capture `was_current` BEFORE `shutil.move` (was: any
  archive cleared `.current-task` pointer regardless of which task was archived)
- `scripts/flow_promote.py:rewrite_frontmatter_for_promotion` — extracted as pure function;
  `strip()` instead of `rstrip()` to avoid blank-line accumulation across re-promotions

### Removed

- `claude/hooks/settings.json.snippet` — superseded by `settings.template.json`

### Pitfalls captured this cycle

1. **render write-through symlink** — first install attempt wrote rendered output back into
   source templates because `~/.claude/skills/flow/` was a legacy symlink to repo. Fixed by
   adding fail-loud detection in `flow_install.py render-prompts` + auto-unlink in `install.sh`.
2. **Sub-agent model selection** — dispatching with `model: sonnet` failed silently when that
   model wasn't accessible in the local environment. Now: don't specify model unless certain.
3. **`shutil.move` then query stale state** — pattern repeats across the codebase; archive
   logic in `flow_task.py` was the surface case but worth promoting to vault.

### Acknowledgments

v0.4 absorbed two external plugins as dependencies:
- [`mksglu/context-mode`](https://github.com/mksglu/context-mode) (Elastic 2.0) — Layer-1 raw
  session persistence + tool output sandboxing
- Anthropic's `ralph-wiggum` pattern — reimplemented in bash to avoid Stop-hook collisions

## v0.3.1-alpha (2026-05-04 later)

Sandbox dogfood test exposed bugs + completed three stubs.

### Bug fixes from dogfood test

- **Phase detection in `user-prompt-submit.py`** — was matching template placeholder
  text ("main session", "promoted", etc.) and reporting fresh task as "done".
  Rewrote `determine_phase` to extract section-by-section and check for non-comment,
  non-template content. Verified across 5 progressive states (empty → done).
- **`progress.md.template`** — simplified to use clear `<!-- TEMPLATE: 未填写 -->`
  markers in each section. Phase detector now reliably distinguishes filled vs
  template state.
- **`flow_conflict.py` regex** — original directive matcher required polarity at
  start of sentence (after `^` / `.\s+` / list bullet). Fixed to use `\b` word
  boundary anywhere; added stop-word filter for subject overlap; lowered
  threshold from 0.5 to 0.4 (with min-based denominator for sensitivity).

### Stubs completed (P1 + P2)

- **`flow_staleness.py` (P1)** — full implementation:
  - Scans memory files for cited path patterns (`.py`, `.ts`, `.md`, etc.)
  - Verifies path existence (project-relative, repo-relative, absolute)
  - Cross-references with `git log -N` to detect "modified after memory written"
  - Outputs human-readable findings or JSON for hook consumption
  - Exits non-zero on stale findings (CI-integrable)
- **`flow_promote.py` (P2)** — criteria validation:
  - Counts archived task mentions, vault MOC mentions, active project mentions
  - Cap warnings (Letta-anchored: vault pattern <300 lines / rules <200 lines)
  - `--check-only` mode prints metrics without promoting
  - `--force` to override criteria; `--confirm-rule` required for Lv3 rules tier
  - Credential grep self-check before write
  - Updates source frontmatter with `status: promoted` + target path + date
- **`pre-tool-task.py` jsonl injection hook (P2)** — Trellis-style:
  - Triggers on `Task` / `Agent` tool calls
  - Reads active task's `implement.jsonl` or `check.jsonl` (heuristic by prompt content)
  - Loads referenced spec files, injects into sub-agent prompt as `additionalContext`
  - 50 KB total / 10 KB per-file caps to avoid context bloat
  - Best-effort: silent exit on missing jsonl

### Stubs completed (P3)

- **`flow_conflict.py`** — heuristic conflict detection:
  - Extracts directives (always/never/must/should + Chinese equivalents) from rules
  - Pairs across files where polarity is opposite + subject overlap ≥ 0.4
  - Outputs suspect pairs for human/Claude review (not auto-resolution)
  - JSON output for hook consumption; scope flag (project/vault/global/all)

### Added

- `flow conflict` subcommand in CLI dispatcher
- `LICENSE` (MIT)
- `docs/USAGE.md` — step-by-step install / first-time setup / daily workflow / troubleshooting / cross-machine sync

### Smoke test results (dogfood task: token-counter CLI)

End-to-end run of all 4 phases on `/tmp/flow-test-real`:
- ✅ flow init → skeleton + .gitignore + ~/.flow/credentials.local
- ✅ flow task create → prd.md + progress.md from templates
- ✅ Phase 1-4 simulation (manual fill of prd.md, then implement, verify, sediment)
- ✅ flow save → journal entry with title / machine_id / status / commits
- ✅ flow task archive → moved to archive/2026-05/
- ✅ All 5 hooks: silent on no-op, correct output on triggers
- ✅ All scripts: idempotent, exit codes correct

### Still deferred

- Triage uses heuristic, not actual Haiku call (slash command guides the model)
- Auto-save does not auto-update `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` (call `/save` skill manually)
- Conflict detection is heuristic (false positives expected); LLM-based verification deferred

## v0.3.0-alpha (2026-05-04)

Initial extraction from vault into installable repo.

### Added

- Repo skeleton + bilingual README + install/uninstall scripts
- All 4 design docs mirrored from vault (`编码框架.md`, `Skills-Phase映射.md`, `框架对比.md`, `调研方法论.md`)
- 9 templates (prd / progress / pitfall / server / topology / ADR / pattern / config / config.local + gitignore snippet)
- 8 slash commands under `claude/commands/flow/` (start / continue / finish / resume / pitfall / promote / codex-review / pause)
- 5 skills under `claude/skills/flow/` (orchestrator + 4 phase skills)
- 4 hooks under `claude/hooks/` (session-start / user-prompt-submit / post-tool-bash / stop)
- Python helpers: `flow_init.py`, `flow_task.py`, `flow_save.py`, `flow_triage.py`, `flow.py` (CLI dispatcher)
- Common utilities: `paths.py`, `config.py`, `git.py`

### Status

- Foundation laid; not yet validated on real coding project
- Auto-checks (`flow_staleness.py`, `flow_conflict.py`, `flow_promote.py`) stubbed
- pre-tool-task.py jsonl injection hook stubbed (Trellis-style spec injection — not yet implemented)

### Known limitations

- Triage uses heuristic, not actual Haiku call (slash command guides the model to do classification)
- Auto-save writes to journal but does not auto-update `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` pointers (manual step)
- No staleness verification on session start (planned v0.3.1)
- No conflict pre-flight on rule load (planned v0.3.1)
